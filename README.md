# Many-to-Many-Relationship
A many-to-many relationship refers to a relationship between tables in a database when a parent row in one table contains several child rows in the second table and vice versa. Many-to-many relationships are often tricky to represent. The many-to-many relationship is usually a mirror of the real-life relationship between the objects of the two tables represent.

About Dataset
The Sakila sample database was initially developed by Mike Hillyer, a former member of the MySQL AB documentation team. It is intended to provide a standard schema that can be used for examples in books, tutorials, articles, samples, and so forth. The Sakila sample database also serves to highlight features of MySQL such as Views, Stored Procedures, and Triggers.
